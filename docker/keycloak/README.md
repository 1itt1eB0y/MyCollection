# Keyclock

Github Official: https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak
Official Documentation: https://www.keycloak.org/documentation.html

An Identity Provider, which provides OIDC, LDAP, and SAML authentication, with WEB interface.

I recommand to use the bitnami's docker image instead of the official docker image.
If you want to use official docker image, check the tutorial here: https://www.keycloak.org/server/containers
